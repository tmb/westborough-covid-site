# westborough-covid-site

call-to-action to Westborough students to give their thoughts on the district's COVID plan. site is by me with copy, survey, and data contributions by @lukec11, @saharshy29, @adway

the most up to date version is at: https://westboroughcovidplan.com but you can look at the GH info for the deploy that this code is for.

project ended well. we got our thoughts to the school committee and the superindendent mentioned our results during a district Q&A.
